# Home-Healthcare-Service
Home Healthcare Service provides an online platform for patients, especially the elderly or those with limited mobility, to access medical care at home. The system will facilitate online appointment booking, detailed doctor information, home checkups, and comprehensive medical records management. The project was developed by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript as frontend, and PHP and MySQL as backend language. As
technology is growing rapidly, we are also moving to a technical world where everything we want is to be online.
